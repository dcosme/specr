Per default, `run_specs()` summarizes individual specifications by using `broom.mixed::tidy()` and "broom::glance()". For most cases, this provides "sufficient" summary of the relationship of interest and model characteristics. Sometimes, however, it might be useful to investigate specific models in more detail or to investigate a specific parameter that is not provided by the two functions (e.g., r-square). This vignette shows how to access individual models and extract further information from them.

## 1. Run specification curve analysis

If we want to investigate individual models and particularly all aspects of that model, we need to use `run_specs()` with the additional argument `keep.results = TRUE`. 

```{r, message=F, warning = F}
library(specr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(performance)

# Run specification curve analysis
results <- run_specs(df = example_data, 
                     y = c("y1", "y2"), 
                     x = c("x1", "x2"), 
                     model = c("lm"), 
                     controls = c("c1", "c2"), 
                     subsets = list(group1 = unique(example_data$group1),
                                    group2 = unique(example_data$group2)),
                     keep.results = TRUE)
```


## 2. Identify model(s) of interest

For this example, we are going to look at two specific models (same independent variables, all controls, all participants, but different dependent variables).

```{r}
(y_models <- results %>%
  filter(x == "x1", 
         controls == "c1 + c2",
         subsets == "all"))
```

As you can see, the resulting tibble includes an additional column called "res". This column includes the entire "model object" and we can use it to further investigate each model. 

## 3. Investigate models

For example, we can now easily get a full summary of the models and compare individual coefficients and statistics. 

```{r}
y_models %>%
  pull(res) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map(coef)
```

Or we could get r-squared values for both models.

```{r}
y_models %>%
  pull(res) %>% 
  map(r2)       # r2 is include in the package "performance"
```


## 4. Some more examples

This way, we can analyze or compare such statistics across several models.

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, message=F, warning = F}
r2_results <- results %>%
  filter(subsets == "all") %>%
  mutate(r2 = map(res, r2), 
         r2 = map_dbl(r2, 1)) %>%
  arrange(r2)

r2_results %>%
  select(x:controls, r2)
```

And we can plot comparisons.

```{r}
r2_results %>%
  arrange(r2) %>%
  mutate(rank = 1:n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, 
             y = r2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.text = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line("black", size = .5),
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "black"))
```
